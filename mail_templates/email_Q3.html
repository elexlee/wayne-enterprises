							<span style="font-size: 30px;">Bruce Wayne</span><br><br>
							<span style="width: 450px; font-size: 16px">I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people, rising from this abyss. I see the lives, for which I lay down my life - peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy. I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known. - Jim Gordan

							It is with a heavy heart that I must write this letter to you all. Today is a dark day as we mourn the passing of Bruce Wayne. Bruce was a man unlike any other and those who knew him personally knew that he constantly placed the needs of Gotham before his own. To me he was a great force to be reckoned with yet a man full of compassion. We hope you join us in this time of mourning and remember him not for his death but for his life and to the extent in which he lived it.
